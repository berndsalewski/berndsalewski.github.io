![Me as a 8bit portrait](/assets/20170819_123012_eightbit.jpeg)

I was born in the winter of 1972 in mid-western Germany, in a part known as the "Ruhrgebiet" (Ruhr Area). "Ruhr" is the river running through this part of the world before it flows into the more famous "Rhein". Traditionally a coal mining region for centuries it was dominated by working class people. People who don't beat around the bush, who say it like it is, straightforward. I was born to a working class family and to this day I prefer people who communicate frankly and clearly. I also have a strong empathy for underdogs. It's part of my DNA.

After a few years or searching and figuring out myself in my young adult years I decided to study Fine Arts. Which I did with a focus on painting and I finished with a diploma degree. After several years of not finishing things this felt huge. During my childhood years I never really had too much contact with computers apart from the occasional gaming session on a friends' Atari ST / C64 / Amiga / PC. Our family did not have the funds to afford a personal computer during the 80s. Did I mention working class? But during my art studies I became more and more interested in the computer as a creative and artistic tool. Playing video games with passion had opened my eyes that there is more to discover in the digital realms than just data in spreadsheets. I became an avid user of Photoshop and Cinema 4D, a 3D Creation solution.

That lead to my studies in Computer Science after I had finished my Art Studies. Agreed, the financial outlook on the general artists life did also help with considering an additional education. I became some kind of hybrid mashup between an artist and a programmer. A cyborg of sorts. 

Jumping to today I work in the game development and creative industries for on and off 15+ years now.
